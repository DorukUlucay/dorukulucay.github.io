<p>I am Doruk Ulu√ßay, a Software Developer with over ten years of full stack and full cycle development experience. For the last couple of years, I completely switched to backend. I am currently employed by Hack and Craft.</p>

<p> I am mainly skilled in .NET, C#, F#, SQL, OOP and Functional Programming. Experienced in DevOps and CI/CD. Familiar with containerization and various cloud platforms.</p>

<p>Besides working in software houses, I also have worked on site with enterprise grade companies that work in fields like fmcg, energy and fleet rental. I have developed and/or maintained; sales, merchandising, forecasting, B2B, B2C, ERP, CRM, online store and game backend apps/services.</p>

<p>I easily adapt to business domain. I understand that software is made to solve business problems. I aim at impact. I build good communication with non-tech people.</p>

<p>I consider best practises like clean coding, reusability, unit testing, documentation and refactoring to be part of my daily job rather than nice-to-haves.</p>
